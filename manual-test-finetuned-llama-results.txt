"Voice-over broadband is a key trend across Europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry," Eric Abensur, Wanadoo's chief executive told the BBC News website.

Rich Templeton, the head of giant chip maker Texas Instruments, has given his backing to the growing sector of Voice over Internet Telephony (Voip). Voip allows PC users, and in some cases those with just a broadband connection, to make telephone calls via the net.

"We can help mass-market adoption of Voip," said AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller.
"We want to communicate freely, effortlessly and economically wherever we are."

The service will cost an extra £4 a month and will come with a free Livebox, the broadband hub which Wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services.

"It's not about the pipe, if you will, or the silicon per se, it's about the application," he said.

The world's largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently. Mr Templeton said Voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes.

Bill Simmelink, general manager of TI's Voip business, said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call.
"We can utilise our national footprint."

Skype lets people make free calls to other Skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. Customers will continue to use their traditional phones, but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company.

The secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home.

Officials will call the phone call to other phones to make up users users users users users users users users users users users users users users users

Cebit, the world's largest hi-tech fair, has opened its doors in Hanover for a look at the latest technologies for homes and businesses.

Cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products, and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright, colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets.

Cebit could become the battleground for the two competing methods for getting TV on to mobiles, and is also likely to provide a stage for a technology slated to compete with 3G.

"The digital home will be a hyped theme at the show. It could be the last big year for Cebit," he said.

Samsung is set to steal some initial limelight with the launch of a 7-megapixel phone on the opening day.

Apple and Motorola announced they were getting together at the end of last year as a result of a long-standing friendship between Motorola's chief executive Ed Zander and Steve Jobs.

Cebit organisers have created a digital home in Hall 25 of the 27 hangar-like buildings that will house the show.

Cebit is set amid a grim set of recent headlines about mobile TV - French operators are teaming up, O2 is trialling a system in Oxford, UK, and Nokia begins trialling a system in Finland with the Finnish Broadcasting Company, YLE TV and commercial TV channels.

Cebit, the world's largest hi-tech fair, has opened its doors in Hanover for a look at the latest technologies for homes and businesses.

"There will be a certain amount of 'look how big mine is'," he said.

For instance, a song which currently takes one and a half minutes to download to a phone could be done in 10 seconds.

Broadband will continue to be a key theme at the show with internet telephony proving this year's killer application.

Rich Templeton, the head of giant chip maker Texas Instruments, has given his backing to the growing sector of Voice over Internet Telephony (Voip)\n\nVoip allows PC users, and in some cases those with just a broadband connection, to make telephone calls via the net. Mr Templeton said Voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. Internet service provider Wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the UK.\n\nSubscribers to Wanadoo\'s broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any UK landline, and free calls at any time to other Wanadoo users. The service will cost an extra Â£4 a month and will come with a free Livebox, the broadband hub which Wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. The secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. Eventually the service will replace existing landline services as Wanadoo goes head to head with BT. "Voice-over broadband is a key trend across Europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry, " Eric Abensur, Wanadoo\'s chief executive told the BBC News website. Mr Templeton said he agreed. "Voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access," he said. The world\'s largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently.\n\nAlmost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the Skype Voip service, according to the net telephony firm\'s website. Skype lets people make free calls to other Skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. US firm Vonage also offers a Voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. Bill Simmelink, general manager of TI\'s Voip business, said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. "It\'s not about the pipe, if you will, or the silicon per se, it\'s about the application," he said.\n\n"We want to communicate freely, effortlessly and economically wherever we are." In a sign that Voip is seeping into the mainstream, giant ISP AOL announced on Tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. Customers will continue to use their traditional phones, but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. Calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. "We can help mass-market adoption of Voip," said AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller. "We can utilise our national footprint. We can help the entire industry become well known.
